Denia Community Board App
This is a simple event board app for a local town, where users can post and delete events. The app is built with React for the front end and Node.js for the backend.

Getting Started
To get started, you'll need to run the server with the following command:

cd backend
npm run server

cd client
npm run start

The server will be running on port 5000, and the routes are set in the routes directory. The app uses MongoDB with Mongoose, and you can find all the details in the config file.

The app also uses an .env file to hide sensitive data that could be stolen.
